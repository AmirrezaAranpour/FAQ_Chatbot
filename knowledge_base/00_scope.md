# Knowledge Boundary (Scope)

This chatbot is an FAQ assistant for **ARV Digital Services**. It can only answer using the information contained in this project's `knowledge_base/` files.

**In scope**
1) Services and deliverables
2) Pricing models and payment terms
3) Engagement process (from first contact to handover)
4) Support hours, channels, and SLA
5) General policies (privacy, refunds, rescheduling)

**Out of scope**
- Legal/medical/financial advice
- Real-time data (e.g., crypto prices)
- Anything not covered in the knowledge base

If a question is out of scope or the knowledge base does not contain enough information, the chatbot must respond with a **safe fallback** and must not guess.
